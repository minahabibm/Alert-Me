# Alert-Me
Hello! Welcome to AlertMe, the app which alerts you on your current crime risk based on your zip code. 
AlertMe uses crafted API in order to notify you based on your current location of crimes committed in your area. 
With AlertMe, you can always feel safe and knowledgeable about your surroundings. 
Now, let’s start by switching your “Notifications” and “Location” to “Always Allow”, 
this can be found on the Settings Screen of the AlertMe App. 
This ensures you receive constant updates when you enter new zip codes. 
Lastly, If you frequent a zip code(s) (I.e. Home, School, Work) you can update this in the Settings section marked “Zip Codes.” 
This allows AlertMe not to alert you in common zip codes you choose. 
So go explore your area and find out your current crime risks, with caution. 
AlertMe will keep you safe and alert, so you can be at ease. Stay Safe out there! 👋🏼😄
